As consumers become more critical about the purchasing decisions they make and the companies support, there is a growing interest to better understand a business' commitment to the environment before doing business with them. Unfortunately that information is extremely difficult to come across. Businesses either do not have a concise way of sharing this information or don't share it at all.

> [/green](http://slashgreen.org) aims to be a canonical source to understand a business' commitment to the environment

To facilitate this, [/green](http://slashgreen.org) proposes companies reserve the /green URL location to be the place to share this information

**<http://yourbusiness.com/green>**

This way, consumers know exactly where to look to find out about a companies commitment to conservation and sustainability.
